This is a game a simple space shooter game complete with a main menu. All code is 100% made by me, however the art & music was not.
About 2 scripts I was unable to recover, and few scripts were needed since Unity has very good built-in systems. Let me know if I should send you a different application instead.
A link to a very un-professional website can be found here where you can download the game: https://modernisttt.itch.io/arcade-games

To download the game simply press the download button, if that does not work please let me know. Thanks!
